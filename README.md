## 📌 What This Is

**Architech v1.5** is the foundational scaffold for the Architech AI platform — an early prototype establishing the project's component architecture, routing structure, and visual design system.

This version contains the **structural skeleton** of the platform: the project layout, styling foundation, navigation patterns, and component organization that informed later iterations. Active feature development began in subsequent versions.

> **Looking for the working Arch1tech platform?** → See [`arch1tech`](https://github.com/BathSalt-2/arch1tech) for the live functional implementation.  
> **For the full product vision?** → See [`Arch1tech-2.0`](https://github.com/BathSalt-2/Arch1tech-2.0) for the complete roadmap.
